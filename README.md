# Android GIF Viewer/Loader
Loading GIF files with animations have always been a challenge when we code for Android devices. Seeing this problem by most of the Android Developers across the globe, I thought of publishing a GIF loader library.

Now to load the GIF images into your Android Application, all you need to do is add a dependency to your app level gradle.build along with the jitpack configuration:

### Installing

1) Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

2) Step 2. Add the dependency
```
	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.adhishlal:gifloader:1.1'
	}
```
Next, go to your XML file wherever you want to show the GIF file along with the animation and add the following widget
```
        <lal.adhish.gifprogressbar.GifView
            android:id="@+id/progressBar"
            android:layout_width="@dimen/_50sdp"
            android:layout_centerInParent="true"
            android:layout_margin="@dimen/_5sdp"
            android:layout_height="@dimen/_50sdp"
            android:layout_gravity="center" />
```
Once this is done, open your Java class where you are inflating the above widgetâ€™s layout and initialise this as shown below and also set the GIF image resource which you want to show:
```
GifView pGif = (GifView) findViewById(R.id.progressBar);
pGif.setImageResource(R.drawable.loader);
```
Bravo! You just did it.

Just compile and run your code.
